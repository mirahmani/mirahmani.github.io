Currently I work as Business Intelligence Engineer which builds end-to-end data solution so everyone in the company and our company's partner can access the required data in timely manner. I am interested in figuring ways to automate the boring stuffs and optimize the workflow so I (and everyone else who benefits from my work) can have time for more important works!

In my free time, I like to read, cook, making arts, and doing some data (or non-data)-related side projects. I also created [youtube channel](https://youtube.com/c/MirasBlackbox) (in Indonesian language) to share what I learned in the data field.
